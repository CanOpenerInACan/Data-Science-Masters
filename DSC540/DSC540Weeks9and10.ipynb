    "Project Gutenberg is a volunteer effort to digitize and archive cultural works, to \"encourage the creation and distribution of eBooks\". It was founded in 1971 by American writer Michael S. Hart and is the **oldest digital library.** This longest-established ebook project releases books that entered the public domain, and can be freely read or downloaded in various electronic formats.\n",

    "* **This activity aims to scrape the url of the Project Gutenberg's Top 100 ebooks (yesterday's ranking) for identifying the ebook links. **\n",
    "* **It uses BeautifulSoup4 for parsing the HTML and regular expression code for identifying the Top 100 ebook file numbers.**\n",
    "* **You can use those book ID numbers to download the book into your local drive if you want**"

    "**Explanation:** Is there an easy way to include all the punctuation that will appear here? I added a couple more that the book didn't include so we could get more of the titles of the books before they were cutoff. It was a real pain to get ' to appear but I got it. The only real problem I see is in stuff like \"The Convict Ship, Volume 3\" which should include more, but is in parenthesis, and if we include parenthesis we get the end of the lines which we don't want. It is mostly done and complete but basically any line that doesn't include \"by\" cut off at some point. Also the set up for this coding was from the assignment links for this week and just had fill in the blank sections that I did. "

I wanted to make a scatter of ages and a typically old person candy (Werther Originals weren't on here so maybe Dots or something) just to see if I could see a difference in ages of people who like things.

And a lot of people just wrote in funny responses. It was a pain and frustrating to get ready to be put into a scatter so I passed"
